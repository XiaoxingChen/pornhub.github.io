<p>
The original blog locates at 
<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/buchunjiedexin">CSDN XiaoxingChen's Blog</a>.
Due to its terrible support of mathematical equation and lacking of version control, I turned to 
log my daily thinkings and notes in private git repo.
So far I start to make some of the contents into public.
Therefore, here is the new site for them.

\[
f_X(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k) = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k |\Sigma|}} 
\text{exp}(-\frac{1}{2}(X - \mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (X - \mu))
\]
