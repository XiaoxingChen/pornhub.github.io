    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
        While estimating the transform between two images, one has to solve the Essential Matrix according to Epipolar Constraint:
    </p>
    \[
        x_2^\top E x_1 = 0 
        \tag{1-1}
    \]
    <p>Five-point-algorithm and eight-point-algorithm are both applicable. 
        Here I take eight-point algorithm as example. The essential matrix is vectorized,
        and equation (1-1) is transformed to a homogeneous equation in form \(Ax = 0\). 
        The homogeneous equation can be solved by SVD, and the essential matrix will be recovered from vector \(x\).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, according to the definition of essential matrix:
    </p>
    \[
    E = \{ S R | S = t^\wedge \in \mathfrak{so}(3), R \in SO(3)\} \tag{1-2}
    \]
    <p>
        Singular values of a essential matrix are \([1,1,0]\) <sup><a href="/2020/01/20/essential_mat_sig_val">[1]</a></sup>.
        In order to make the solution "essential", a general solution<sup>[2]</sup> is to SVD the result and replace its singular value with \([1,1,0]\).
        The matrix \(\hat E\) is the projection of matrix \(E\) on essential manifold. 
        Then, the rotation matrix and translation vector can be recovered.
    </p>
    \[
        \hat E = U_E \text{diag}(1,1,0)  V_E^\top
        \tag{1-3}
    \]
    <p>
        In this article, I am going to implement an optimization based method to find the essential matrix. 
    </p>
    <h1>Problem Formulation</h1>
    <h2>Parameterize</h2>
    <p>
        There are few papers talking about the properties of essential manifold.
        Let's see what will happen if I solve the problem with only constraint the rotation matrix.
        I parameterize the essential matrix to a 6-dimensional vector: 3-dimensional translation vector and 3-dimension rotation.
        But it was denied after I found the equation will always converge at the point where translation vector \(t = [0,  0,  0]^\top\).
        This is where "pure rotation" happens, the constraint "degenerated". 
        Therefore, I finally added a constraint \(\|t\| = 1\), to restrict the translation vector on a unit sphere.
        If I can turn the unit sphere manifold to a Lie Group, the the solution can be solve as what one do to the rotation part.
        Unluckily, the answer was "NO": 
        <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3481290/can-every-manifold-be-turned-into-a-lie-group">
            \(S^2\) manifold cannot be given a Lie Group structure</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, the idea of constrained optimization is to iterate the state vector without breaking the constraint.
        The translation vector on unit sphere has degree of 2, the essential matrix was then vectorized to \(E = [\tau_x, \tau_y, \psi_x, \psi_y, \psi_z]^\top\). 
        Every step I calculate the jacobian of the translation vector in two orthogonal directions. 
        In order to preserve the incremental direction, the translation vector is stored in a orthonormal matrix \(T = [t_x, t_y, t_z], T \in SO(3)\).
        The first two columns of the matrix \(t_x, t_y\) indicates the incremental directions, the last column \(t_z\) is the vector itself.
    </p>
    <h2>Cost Function</h2>
    <p>Residual: </p>
    \[
        f(x) = x_1^\top t_z^\wedge R x_2 \tag{2-1}
    \]

    <p>The problem then comes to:</p>
    \[
        \text{arg}\ \text{min} F(t_z, R) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1} ^ n \|f(t_z, R)\|^2 
        = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1} ^ n 
        \left( 
            (x_{1,i}^\top t_z^\wedge R x_{2,i})^\top (x_{1,i}^\top t_z^\wedge R x_{2,i}) 
        \right)
        \tag{2-2}
    \]

    <h2>Jacobian</h2>
    <p>I use numerical method to calculate the jacobian.</p>
    \[
        J = 
        \left[
        \begin{matrix}
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial \tau_x} &
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial \tau_y} &
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi_x} &
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi_y} &
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi_z}
        \end{matrix}
        \right]
        \tag{2-3}
    \]
    <h2>Update</h2>
    \[
        \begin{cases}
            \Delta \tau = [\Delta \tau_x, \Delta \tau_y, 0]^\top\\
            T_k = \text{exp} (\Delta \tau ^ \wedge) T_{k-1} \\
            t_{z,k} = T_{k[:,3]} \\ 
            R_k = \text{exp} (\Delta \psi ^ \wedge) R_{k-1}
        \end{cases}
        \tag{2-4}
    \]

    <h1>Simulation</h1>
    <p>
        Two cameras were set at position \((0.5, -0.8, 0.5)m\) and \((0.6, -0.8, 0.5)m\), 
        their orientations were presented in rotation vectors: \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0, 0)rad\), \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0.1, 0)rad\).
        Totally 60 points were generated.

    <p>The Gauss-Newton method was used to calculate the update. 
        Given initial value \(t = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)\), \(\psi = (0, -0.1, 0)\)
        The cost converged within 10 iterations.
